# Hybrid AC/DC Microgrid Simulation (Grid-Connected Mode)

##  Overview
This project presents a MATLAB/Simulink simulation of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid operating in grid-connected mode.  
The model analyzes power flow, voltage stability, and control performance under steady-state conditions.

##  Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Simscape Electrical

## System Description
- AC Grid
- DC Bus
- Power electronic converters
- Control strategies for grid synchronization

##  Project Structure
- `Model/` – Simulink models (.slx)
